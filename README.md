# VNDS player

A player for visual novels in VNDS format.

VNDS (Visual Novel DS) is a very simple Visual Novel script system originally built for NDS. It provides a better, simpler, and longer lasting framework standard for playing visual novels. It's designed for simple novels with decision trees though; for bigger ones or more advanced plot structures, you'll need RenPy.
